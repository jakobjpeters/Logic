# [Operators](@id operators_operators)

Operators accept `Bool`s, [Nullary Operators](@ref nullary_operators), and [`Proposition`](@ref PAndQ.Proposition)s. Operations on symbolic expressions are not simplified.

Typing symbols with tab completion is performed by typing `\`, followed by the given characters, and then the `[TAB]` key. For example, `‚ä§` is typed with `\top[TAB]`. See also [Tab Completion](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#Tab-completion) and [Unicode Input](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/unicode-input/).

Operator associativity determines how operators with the same precedence group their operands. For example, `‚àß` is left associative. Therefore, `p ‚àß q ‚àß r` is equivalent to `(p ‚àß q) ‚àß r`. Operator precedence determines how expressions with distinct operators are grouped together. Higher precedence operators will group their operands before lower precedence operators. For example, `‚àß` has a higher precedence than `‚à®`. Therefore, `p ‚à® q ‚àß r` is equivalent to `p ‚à® (q ‚àß r)`, even though both operators are left associative. See also Julia's documentation on [Operator Precedence and Associativity](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/mathematical-operations/#Operator-Precedence-and-Associativity).

!!! info
    `==` has a precedence of 7, which is higher than that of several binary operators. For those cases, you may need to use parentheses. For example, `@atomize p ‚Üí q == r` parses as `@atomize p ‚Üí (q == r)` rather than `@atomize (p ‚Üí q) == r`.

## [Binary Operators](@id binary_operators)

!!! tip
    Each binary operator `bo` has been [curried](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying)
    such that `bo(p) = Base.Fix2(bo, p)` and `bo(p)(q) == bo(q, p)`.

## [Nary Operators](@id nary_operators)

!!! tip
    It is more performant to perform a reduction of propositions contained in a `tuple`.
    Using other containers may be type unstable due to the internal representation of propositions.
